[ESP-12 spec](https://www.mikrocontroller.net/attachment/243558/fcc_11.pdf)

ESP-12 modules have metal shield with FCC logo on it. It appears these modules are FCC approved (FCC ID: 2ADUIESP-12). The modules have 16 pins and PCB antenna. Similar to ESP-07, some ESP-12 boards have GPIO 4 and 5 switched.  The newer ESP-12-E module adds 5 more half-hole (without extra hole) pins on the side. There are also two more variations of ESP-12-E module: ESP-12-D and ESP-12-Q. Probably referring to Dual and Quad SPI operations for Flash chip because ESP-12-D frees up GPIO 9 and GPIO 10 which are usually occupied for Quad mode SPI operations.
