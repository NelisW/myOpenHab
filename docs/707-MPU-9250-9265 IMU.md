Data sheets are available on this website


The MPU-925x™ family of parts are the world’s leading 9-axis MotionTracking devices designed for battery operated, high performance consumer electronics products.

The 9-axis product family incorporates the same market proven MotionFusion™ and run-time calibration that is supported in InvenSense’s market leading MPU-65xx family of products. This solution has shipped in millions of units and has been very well market validated.

9-Axis MotionTracking has become a key function in many consumer electronics devices including smartphones, tablets, and wearables. The size advantage of the integrated 9 axis devices versus a discrete solution is compelling for space constrained products such as smartphones and wearable sensors.

The MPU-925x devices combine a 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis compass in the same chip together with an onboard Digital Motion Processor™ (DMP™) capable of processing the complex MotionFusion algorithms.
