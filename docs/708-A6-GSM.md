# A6 GSM module

 1. get the board, insert the SIM card and check the DIP switch is correct, note: SIM card holder in the back of the adapter plate A6; DIP switch 1,3,5,6 open it;

   2. Plug USB, turn on the power can be turned on;

   3. The boot process due to the start-up module and Shun can link cloud, the process may take longer;

   4. Open the serial port, you can see the boot process serial output, default serial port to send data can be forwarded directly to the A6 module can be directly knock AT test;

   5. If you want to call, enter the destination number via the keyboard, you can press the dial key, default headset, pay attention to plug in your headphones (with MIC), if you want to hang up the phone, press the key again you can dial in the input state long press dial / delete key to backspace to delete characters;

   6. If finished entering numbers, press the SMS button to send a test message destination number;

   7.GPRS data services available through EMC App, you can control the development board three color lights, buzzer;
